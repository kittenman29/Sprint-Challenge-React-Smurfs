Server-side routing requires the entire page to refresh every time the user wants to navigate to a new URL.  Client-side routing preloads the entire page so that when you jump from URL to URL the page doesn't need to be refreshed every time.

Create = POST
Read = GET
Update = PUT
Delete = DELETE

Not sure what this is asking?  Match, Location, History?  Or is it asking for HTTP methods like I listed above?  Or is it asking for tools/libraries to use AJAX requests like Postman or chrome plugins like JSON Formatter?
